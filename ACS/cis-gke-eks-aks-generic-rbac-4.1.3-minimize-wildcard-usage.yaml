  policyName: CIS-GKE-EKS-AKS-Generic-RBAC-4.1.3 - Minimize wildcard use in Roles and ClusterRoles
  description: 'CIS Kubernetes Benchmark 4.1.3: Minimize wildcard use in Roles and ClusterRoles'
  rationale: Using wildcards (*) in RBAC roles grants overly broad permissions that violate the principle of least privilege. This increases the attack surface and potential for privilege escalation.
  remediation: |
    Review roles and clusterroles for wildcard usage:
    kubectl get roles,clusterroles -A -o yaml | grep -B 2 -A 2 '"\*"'
    
    Replace wildcards with specific resources and verbs:
    kubectl edit role/clusterrole [role-name]
    
    Example - Change from:
      resources: ["*"]
      verbs: ["*"]
    To:
      resources: ["pods", "services"]
      verbs: ["get", "list"]
