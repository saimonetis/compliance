spec:
  policyName: CIS-GKE-EKS-AKS-Generic-RBAC-4.1.4 - Minimize access to create pods
  description: 'CIS Kubernetes Benchmark 4.1.4: Minimize access to create pods'
  rationale: The ability to create pods provides significant control over the cluster, including potential privilege escalation through pod specifications. This access should be limited to authorized users and service accounts only.
  remediation: |
    Review roles and clusterroles with pod creation permissions:
    kubectl get roles,clusterroles -A -o yaml | grep -A 10 -B 5 '"pods"'
    
    Remove unnecessary create, update, patch, delete verbs for pods:
    kubectl edit role/clusterrole [role-name]
    
    Use more specific permissions like:
      resources: ["pods"]
      verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
    
    Instead of broad creation permissions.
