  policyName: CIS-GKE-EKS-AKS-Generic-Container - Prevent privileged containers
  description: 'CIS Kubernetes Benchmark: Ensure containers do not run in privileged mode'
  rationale: Privileged containers have access to all Linux capabilities and host devices, effectively providing root access to the host system. This significantly increases the attack surface and potential for container escape.
  remediation: |
    Remove privileged: true from container specifications:
    kubectl get pods -A -o yaml | grep -B 5 -A 5 privileged
    
    Edit deployments to remove privileged access:
    kubectl edit deployment [deployment-name]
    
    Remove or set to false:
      spec.template.spec.containers[].securityContext.privileged: false
    
    Use specific capabilities instead of privileged mode when elevated permissions are needed.
